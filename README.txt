Project MMO: Skill Books

This mod adds many different skill books that give you XP or Levels in Project MMO Skills

It also adds a basic class system. You can only take a maximum of 2 classes, and 1 subclass per those classes. I am still adding classes and subclasses.
These have no configuration in any way, you must add the perks and loot tables yourselves for these to drop.
